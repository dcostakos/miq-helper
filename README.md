# miq-helper
ManageIQ Automation Helper

miq-helper is a ruby gem that contains reusable ruby methods and code snippets that can be reused throughout
ManageIQ or CloudForms automation.  The goal of the code is to 
* Provide reusability in Automate code in ManageIQ/CloudForms
* Provide advanced debugging code directly in Automate
* provide a simple mechanism to access this code

This code is very early and has had little to no peer review.  Comments, thoughts, pulls and updates are all welcome.

Thanks.
